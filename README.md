This is a mini web app to provide a poll of voting intention for an upcoming (General) election. The web app allows a user to specify their constituency along with enter answers to the questions "Are you going to vote?" and "Who are you going to vote for?". Finally, the app displays the results for all users nationally and for each constituency.
